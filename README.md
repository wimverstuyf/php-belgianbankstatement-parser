Unified parser for several bank statement formats from Belgian banks.
Supports CODA, MT940 and CSV (BNP Paribas / Belfius / KBC / ING)

## Installation

You can install Codelicious/BelgianBankStatement using Composer. You can read more about Composer and its main repository at
[http://packagist.org](http://packagist.org "Packagist"). First install Composer for your project using the instructions on the
Packagist home page, then define your dependency on Codelicious/BelgianBankStatement in your `composer.json` file.

```json
    {
        "require": {
            "codelicious/php-belgianbankstatement-parser": "^2.0"
        }
    }
```

Or you can execute the following command in your project root to install this library:

```sh
composer require codelicious/php-belgianbankstatement-parser
```

## Usage

```php
<?php

use Codelicious\BelgianBankStatement;

$parser = new Parser();
$statement = $parser->parseFile('coda-file.cod', 'coda');

echo $statement->getDate()->format('Y-m-d') . "\n";

foreach ($statement->getTransactions() as $transaction) {
    echo $transaction->getAccount()->getName() . ": " . $transaction->getAmount() . "\n";
}

echo $statement->newBalance() . "\n";
```

## Encoding considerations

It's possible that non UTF-8 characters are present in the statements.
In order to unify the encoding of your ingested statements, you might want to consider converting the encoding to UTF-8.

```php
$content = file_get_contents($_FILES['csv_file']['tmp_name']);

if (mb_detect_encoding($content, ['UTF-8', 'ISO-8859-1']) === 'ISO-8859-1') {
  // use mb_convert_encoding($content, to_encoding, from_encoding) to convert to UTF-8
  $content = mb_convert_encoding($content, "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1");
}

$content = str_replace("\r", "", $content);
$statements = $parser->parse($content, 'csv_kbc');
```
